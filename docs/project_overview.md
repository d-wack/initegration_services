# Integration Services Project Overview

## Project Description
This monorepo contains a suite of microservices designed to handle various aspects of third-party integrations, with a specific focus on Monday.com and HubSpot integration. The project follows a modular architecture with shared libraries and utilities, emphasizing security, scalability, and configurability.

## Architecture Overview

### Services

1. **Webhook Service (Service1)**
   - Receives and processes webhooks from third-party services
   - Implements queue-based system for webhook storage
   - Configurable database backend (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
   - Ensures reliable webhook processing and retry mechanisms

2. **OAuth Service (Service2)**
   - Manages OAuth authentication for third-party providers
   - Securely stores provider credentials
   - Provides internal API for token management
   - Handles token refresh and rotation
   - Implements secure credential storage

3. **Logger Service (Service3)**
   - Centralized logging, metrics, and tracing
   - Configurable storage backends:
     - Local files
     - Databases (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL)
     - Third-party providers (Grafana Cloud/CloudWatch)
   - Standardized logging format
   - Metrics collection and aggregation
   - Distributed tracing support

4. **Integration Service (Service4)**
   - Monday.com to HubSpot integration
   - Processes queued webhooks
   - Bi-directional data synchronization
   - Uses OAuth service for authentication
   - Implements retry and error handling

### Shared Components

- **Common Libraries**
  - Database abstractions
  - Authentication utilities
  - HTTP clients
  - Queue management
  - Configuration management

- **Utilities**
  - Logging utilities
  - Error handling
  - Testing frameworks
  - Security utilities
